# php-roblox-clone-style

The stylesheets for [php-roblox-clone](https://github.com/iwannaplayminicraft/php-roblox-clone).
This repository contains the frontend for php-roblox-clone, which means this will be sat along side the repository. Previously I stated this repository will be privated once finished, but I've since planned to keep the repository permanently public.

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone into your desired folder
2. Open Command Prompt in project directory
3. Type `npm install`

This project is best paired with the Live Server extension (VS Code), as it provides real time updates to HTML and CSS through refreshing.

## Sass Compile Instructions

If you are running Windows, run `windows.bat` or CD into the repository folder and type `windows.bat`

If you are running Linux, open a termianl and CD into the repository folder and type `bash linux.sh`
